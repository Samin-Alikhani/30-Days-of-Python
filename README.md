# 30 Days of Python Challenge


## Introduction

Welcome to my "30 Days of Python" challenge repository! This challenge is part of my journey to improve my Python programming skills by building a variety of small projects over 30 consecutive days. Each day, I will tackle different concepts and applications of Python, ranging from simple tasks like creating calculators to more complex ones such as building web scrapers or exploring data visualization.

## Objective

The primary goal of this challenge is to enhance my proficiency in Python through consistent practice and project-based learning. By the end of these 30 days, I aim to have a solid portfolio of projects demonstrating a wide range of skills and a deeper understanding of Python's capabilities.
Repository Structure

This repository is organized by day, with each directory containing all the necessary files for that day's project:
